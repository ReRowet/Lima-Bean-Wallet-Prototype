LIMA BEAN WALLET

This is a very early-stage experimental wallet, built from scratch using vanilla technologies (pure HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks)  frontend-only, no React, Vue, etc. Itâ€™s a simple, raw prototype designed for testing and development.

For a more advanced and feature-rich wallet, check out the original Lima Bean Wallet - GhostNet project here:
